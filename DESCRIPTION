Title: General Covariance Modeling with INLA
Description: This package provides a wrapper around the INLA package to simplify modeling data using weighted additive covariance matrices. It provides a simple lme4-like formula syntax. It is partly meant as a drop-in (Bayesian) replacement for the regress package, which is no longer maintained. It also has additional functionality over regress, including 'nested' covariance effects.
